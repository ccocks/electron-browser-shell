# Unimplementable Features

This document lists features from the 50-point plan that are likely not implementable within the current scope of the project.

*   **Text Translation:** Integrating a translation service would require significant backend infrastructure and API keys for a service like Google Translate, which is beyond the scope of a frontend-focused project.
*   **Sync Across Devices:** A full sync implementation would require a dedicated server and user authentication system, which is a major project in itself.
*   **Phishing and Malware Protection:** This feature relies on a constantly updated database of malicious URLs (like Google Safe Browsing), which requires a backend service and API access.
